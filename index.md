# Why am I creating a static website?

I am creating a static website as part of the Microsoft Training [Collaborate with others with Markdown and GitHub Pages](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/collaborate-markdown-github-pages/).

## Want to create your own static website?

The third module of the training mentioned previously is about [Creating and hosting websites using GitHub Pages](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/create-host-web-sites-github-pages/). Go to the course to learn how to create your own.
